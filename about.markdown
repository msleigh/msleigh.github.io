I'm Michael, and I'm the Head of Integrated Forecast Systems at the [European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts](https://www.ecmwf.int).

I'm a physicist by background (I was previously the Group Leader for Computational Physics, and the Head of Profession for Physics and Maths, at [AWE](https://www.awe.co.uk), and I'm a [Fellow of the Institute of Phyics](https://membership.iop.org/fellow-finstp)).

Now I'm interested in programming, software engineering / software development, high-performance computing, numerical modelling, and computing and technology in general. My personal interests include playing classical guitar, music, hiking, gardening, and coding.
