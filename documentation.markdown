These are links to different projects' documentation. The source code for each project, `<project>`, can be found at `https://github.com/msleigh/<project>`. In each, the documentation is built locally and pushed to a special branch `gh-pages` which causes it to be automatically available at the link `https://msleigh.github.io/<project>`.
