## Set up

Details here: [Creating a mathematics blog with Jekyll](https://medium.com/coffee-in-a-klein-bottle/creating-a-mathematics-blog-with-jekyll-78cdee0339f3a) and [MathJax - Getting Started](https://www.mathjax.org/#gettingstarted).

## Notation

We need to use:

    \\( ... \\)

and:

    \\[ ... \\]

as the delimiters for in-line maths and displayed equations, respectively, i.e. the `\` must be escaped.

However:

    $$ ... $$

can also be used as the delimiters for displayed equations (but `$ ... $` can't be used as delimiters for in-line maths).

See [https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/input/tex/delimiters.html](https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/input/tex/delimiters.html).

## Test

When \\(a \\ne 0\\), there are two solutions to \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\) and they are:

  $$ x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$
